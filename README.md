# Fin_Sim
A financial simulation Android app that challenges users to make difficult decisions based on their social, physical, and financial situations.
Inspiration
We wanted to make an app so that it is easily accessible to our audience, young adults who can learn the basics of financial education while balancing the other aspects of their life in simulated real life situations. Players are assigned a character from a random background (i.e. a business woman with 3 kids who lives in NYC, a retired lady with medical bills for her arthritis, etc). You are asked questions in a quiz-like format and must make decisions as that person with their given restrictions.

What it does
It educates users on the compromises one might need to consider to maintain a balance of financial, social, and physical well-being.

How we built it
Android Studio, Pixel 2 API, Java, Git

Challenges we ran into
Passing data from each Android activity; division of labor.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making a functioning app in less than 12 hours.

What's next for FinSim
Potential features include physical, social, and financial status bars to facilitate in decision-making and customizable avatars.
